# Trivia Unleashed - A Timed Quiz Experience

**Trivia Unleashed** is an interactive mobile app that provides a timed quiz experience, where users can answer trivia questions from different categories. Players can customize their quiz experience by selecting the number of questions, difficulty level, and question type (multiple choice or true/false). The app presents questions in an engaging way, marking answers as correct or incorrect, and provides a performance rating at the end based on the user's score. Users can also track their performance, view detailed statistics such as total time taken, and average time per question.

## Development Process

This app was developed using SwiftUI to create an interactive and responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations. The trivia questions and answers were fetched dynamically, and I used a combination of `Timer` and `State` to manage the quiz timing and user interactions. Smooth transitions and engaging animations were added to enhance the user experience.

## Challenges Faced

- **Timer Implementation**: Managing the timer functionality and ensuring it worked smoothly with question submission was challenging. I had to ensure the UI remained visually appealing while keeping track of the timer.
- **State Management**: Tracking the number of correct answers, calculating performance metrics like average time, and ensuring the data flowed smoothly between views required careful planning.
- **Answer Shuffling**: I encountered some syntax errors while trying to shuffle the answer choices, which delayed implementation.

## Key Takeaways

- Gained experience with creating dynamic and interactive quiz apps using SwiftUI.
- Learned how to manage state and transitions effectively in a quiz app.
- Enjoyed designing a results screen that‚Äôs both informative and visually appealing.
